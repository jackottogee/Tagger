Software Developer (Java)
We are Lightfoot, a high-growth technology company based just outside Exeter that is trying to make a difference worldwide, one driver at a time.
We help businesses and private motorists improve performance and safety. Our technology has been proven to reduce fuel use and emissions rates by 10-20%, and at-fault accidents and wear and tear by 40-50%.
Our technology connects to your vehicle’s on-board computer and uses the live data it produces to analyse how efficiently you are driving. It’s similar to the way performance is analysed in Formula 1. Lightfoot turns all that data into simple feedback for you – the driver – so you know when you’re pushing your vehicle too far and can bring it back to maximum efficiency.
We’re a fun-loving bunch who are growing at an astonishing rate. We’ve moved into a brand-new, state-of-the-art office near Exeter and are excited to keep growing the Lightfoot family with like-minded, passionate individuals.
