Day to Day 


You’ll be joining a small but growing product team, with people working on Back End, UX/UI and a founder CTO. 


Your team is responsible for building, delivering and maintaining nothing short of brilliant software. 


What this means is you will be involved in all stages, from developing the technical insights that underpin good ideas, right the way through to planning, building, release and monitoring of real-world products. 


The team will work to Agile practices, creating magic functionality over two-week sprints. 
 
Culture 


We’re building cohesive teams of people that play to their strengths, support others where they can and go the extra mile. 


We’re honest, we trust each other and want you to speak up if you have something you’d like to say. You will be heard and your team-mates will care about what you have to say. 
 
You will develop within a Microservices architecture, but will likely be contributing to our legacy systems while we are in a transition period. 


Be prepared to move fast, we have a lot of work to do together!
