building an information scraper that takes information mainly from the Internet, i.e. financial feeds, blogs and other websites
this information will need to be standardised into a curated format, which would require, filtering, extraction, cleansing and formatting of the raw information (where information can become an "Event")
such emitted Events will be posted onwards for further processing into other workstreams (eg Monday.com API via Python, or a language model to summarise text back), which could be a usability score and other added interactive or static derived information fields
the Events (and such added information) will have to be stored into a database for future reference and potential development (say Machine Learning)
each individual individual scraper will need to be maintained and a separate monitoring / back up system will need to be created
native Python knowledge and experience is a hard requirement
need someone with extensive web scraping knowledge, eg how to scrape JS content
need someone that is happy to deploy machine learning modules in Python
need someone that can work on Monday.com API via Python
need someone that understand the Liquid format/templating language
need someone that can handle a server (Digital Ocean) where the scraoing software will run
phantomJSCloud and Selenium knowledge will come in handy
