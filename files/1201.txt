 My client develops business software that helps their customers to handle their core business easily and efficiently.
 
 They also work with partners to implement new solutions.
 
 You probably already have a lot of experience. You know your tasks very well and it is a matter of course for you to get involved in new customer projects. You take on new requirements and, together with one of our well-rehearsed Scrum team, develop solutions that inspire customers.
 
 To do this, you form the interface between our customers and the development team. You are responsible for ensuring that the requirements are correctly understood and implemented based on user stories. You are the professional sparring partner in the team and accompany your story through the iterative development process through to acceptance. You present the implemented features to our customers on a regular basis. In connection with your work, you are happy to agree to visit our customers on site. Together in the team you are responsible for the successful project management, taking into account the scope of delivery, costs and deadlines.
